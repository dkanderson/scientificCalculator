# Scientific Calculator App

## Overview

This project is a simple and extensible calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates core front-end concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, state management, and math operations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Support for factorial, roots, degrees/radians mode
- Responsive UI layout
- Clean and modular JavaScript logic

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS3** for layout and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for functionality

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## How It Works

- Buttons in the UI trigger JavaScript functions.
- Internal state is preserved using closures.
- Operations are computed and displayed on the calculator screen.

## Future Improvements

- ~~Add scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, rad, etc)~~
- Improved mobile layout
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Better Keyboard support
- Add calculator icon to button for expanding calculator
- ~~Use Shunting yard, tokens and RPN to improve logic~~
- ~~Add support for nested functions in UI~~
